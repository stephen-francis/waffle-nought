Generates all valid book representations of complete graphs with vertices 5-9.

This code was used in directed research at Merrimack College to investigate the
properties of book representations of complete graphs.

The algorithm for generating all the possible edge configurations to create book
representations works. However, the code needs some refactoring and interface
improvement.
